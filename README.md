# OpenAI_LLM_Podcast_Summariser
Uplimit course taught by Ted Sanders of OpenAI and Sidharth Ramachandran. Utilises the Large Language Model ChatGPT to create an app that generates a weekly newsletter summarising podcasts. The app summarises podcast episodes, identifies podcast guests, and identifies key highlights.  

The approach is split into three parts:

Part 1: Use a large language model from OpenAI to build the information extraction functionality, paired with a speech-to-text model for transcribing the podcast.

Part 2: Utilise Modal, a cloud deployment provider, to easily convert the information extraction function to run on demand – this is the app backend.

Part 3: Use ChatGPT from OpenAI as a coding assistant to create and deploy a front-end that allows users to experience the end-to-end functionality.
